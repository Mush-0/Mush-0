### Hi there 👋

If you don't know my name call me Musho 😄💕
I`m currently a web developer on my journey to learn as much interesting things as i can 🤯😲

I’ve worked on some tools for a game called SoulWorker and created two sites for it here [VS Calculator](https://mush-0.github.io/VS-Calc/) [SW Damage Chart](https://mush-0.github.io/sw-dmg-chart/).

If you are interested you can always contact me on my discord [Musho- (•̀ᴗ•́)ง#7885](https://discord.com/users/287203639486054412)
